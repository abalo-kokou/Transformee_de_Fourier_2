# Transformee_de_Fourier_2
Our program, named "TransformFourier", provides as an output the
Fourier transform of an image given as an input then the inverse Fourier Transform of the
spectrum obtained. For its execution, simply follow the following steps:
   -> Launch a Linux terminal, so switch to command mode;
   -> Go to the directory containing the source file and the makefile.
